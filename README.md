# Code Refactor Project

The main goal of this project was to refactor a simple websites html and css. The objective was to make the code more readable for developers editing the project. I started off by making all of the semantic tags more appropriate. Changing "div" to tags like "section", "header" and "article". After this, I had starting editing the CSS to be more efficient. There were repeats of attributes for multiple classes that could be merged to one. After refactoring the CSS, I added notes to each sections of the code for both the HTML and the CSS. This concluded my challenge.

The CSS is in the assets folder. The HTML is on the main part of the repository not in any folder.
